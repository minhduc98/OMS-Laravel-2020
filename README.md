The project is built based on my old project in the internship of USTH.
The goal of the system is to manage the diploma and transcript of bachelor in our university USTH.

Some guides for the newbie to the system:
- There is still some data that I made for the system.
- To check the transcript exportation, you have to use student_code = USTHBI8-159 and, 
    + First Year for year position and Foundation Science for major
    + Second Year for year position and ICT for major
- To import Excel for Profile and Diploma screen, you have to use my Excel forms here:
